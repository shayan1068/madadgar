## **Introduction**
Pakistan, as an underdeveloped country, faces significant challenges, with poverty being one of the foremost issues. Many people struggle to meet basic needs such as shelter, food, clothing, healthcare, and education. Simultaneously, others have surplus resources they can donate but lack a proper platform to do so.

Madadgar bridges this gap by creating an online platform that connects donors with deserving individuals. This system not only addresses the daily needs of the poor but also prevents wastage of resources by utilizing unused items effectively.

### **Key Features**
- **Donor Page:** Enables donors to provide specific details of the items they wish to donate.
- **Donee Page:** Allows needy individuals to specify their requirements.
- **Login/Registration:** Both donors and donees must register to use the platform.
- **Item Details:** Facilitates donors to specify item details such as sizes for clothes and shoes.
- **Healthcare Support:** Advertisements for medical help requests are displayed to encourage healthcare donations.
- **Job Opportunities:** A dedicated section for providing job opportunities to skilled but underprivileged individuals.

- A platform for seamless donation.
